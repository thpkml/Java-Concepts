# Some Basic Java Concepts
The repo contains implementation of some basic ideas in Java. 
## What
The files are not a structured lesson on Java.  
They are added as a part of my own learning journey during in 2017 BTEC HND course.  
I did not want to clutter the repo with everything I learned.   
Hence, only the things that I found interesting during my study are added here.
## Why
This repo has a dual purpose: 
- everytime I need to relearn some forgotten java basics, I visit the repo.  
I find it better than trying to locate the files one of my local machines. 
- anyone else with the same reason can do so too
## Who
- for beginners in java
- for anyone who's lost track of some basics
## Usage
Feel free to use the codes as you like. Share if someone needs it.
